### Solution
1. Some important lectures can be missed by this approach.
2. It can be optimal solution if the importance of the lecture is missed.

![solution 59](https://github.com/cpp-rakesh/discrete_mathematics_and_its_applications/blob/master/chapter_3_algorithms/3.1_algorithms/exercises/repo/images/solution_59_a.jpg)

### Solution b)

If we have less halls let's just 2 in this above example, we can't book all the meeting rooms.
In that case we can't schedule all meetings and we need to drop some.
See the result if the meeting halls are only 2.
