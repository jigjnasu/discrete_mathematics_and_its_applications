![Question 1](https://github.com/cpp-rakesh/discrete_mathematics_and_its_applications/blob/master/chapter_1_the_foundations_logic_and_proofs/1.1_propositional_logic/exercises/repo/q1.png)
#### Solution

a) This is a proposition, with Truth value = T.\
b) This is NOT a proposition, with Truth value = F, as the capital of Florida is Tallahassee.\
c) This is a proposition, with Truth value = T.\
d) This is NOT a proposition, with Truth value = F, as 5 + 7 = 12.\
e) This is NOT a proposition, as we need x to compute the equation.\
f) This is NOT a proposition.

![Question 2](https://github.com/cpp-rakesh/discrete_mathematics_and_its_applications/blob/master/chapter_1_the_foundations_logic_and_proofs/1.1_propositional_logic/exercises/repo/q2.png)
#### Solution
a) This is not a proposition, it is a command.\
b) This is not a proposition, it is a question.\
c) This is a proposition as truth value = False.\
d) This is not a proposition, as we need x to compute the equation.\
e) This is a proposition, as moon is made up of rocks not cheese, say cheese :).\
f) This is not a proposition, as we need n to compute the equation.


![Question 3](https://github.com/cpp-rakesh/discrete_mathematics_and_its_applications/blob/master/chapter_1_the_foundations_logic_and_proofs/1.1_propositional_logic/exercises/repo/q3.png)
#### Solution
a) Mei does not have an MP3 player.\
b) There is pollution in New Jersey.\
c) $2 + 1 \ne 3$.\
d) We can't write "Summer in Maine is not hot and sunny", because we need to assume that there are well defined notions of hot and sunny. Otherwise, this would need not be a proposition because of not having a definite truth value.

![Question 4](https://github.com/cpp-rakesh/discrete_mathematics_and_its_applications/blob/master/chapter_1_the_foundations_logic_and_proofs/1.1_propositional_logic/exercises/repo/q4.png)
#### Solution
a) Jennifer and Teja are not friends.\
b) Baker's item dozen value is not equal to 13.\
c) It is incorrect to say that the negation is "Abby sent at most 100 text messages every day.". Correct negation should be "There exists a day on which Abby sent at most 100 text messages".\
d) 121 is NOT a perfect square.
